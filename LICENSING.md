## Licensing  
Unless any files state otherwise, all files are under a license. You may freely distribute, reverse-engineer, and re-use the files as long as you follow the following rules:  
 1. The following terms are defined as follows:
    1. 'The files', 'all files', and any other variations refer to the files in this project (encryptor.py and encryptionlib.py), excluding those that are exempt (devtools.py)
 2. The files may only be used in ways the laws of your country permit you to.
 3. You may not use any of the code, systems, or concepts, from this code to develop software relating to, but not limited to:
     a. Malware. (e.g. Ransomware)
     b. Payment gateways or other applications that involve processing payment details.
     c. Military security software, or security software for any other high-security organisation.
     d. Proprietary software, paid software, or software that is closed-source.
 4. You may not redistribute encryptor.py without encryptionlib.py and devtools.py. All files must be redistributed with LICENSING.md  
 5. You MUST leave the attributions at the top of the files INTACT and UNMODIFIED.  
    1. You are granted the option to add your name, a year, and a short comment as a **single-line** comment **no longer than** 120 characters, if you make modifications to a file. This addition may only be in copies that contain your modifications. You may only add one of these comments on each file.
    2. Modifying the comments at the top of the files, in any way other than in accordance with section 6.1, violates sections 6 and 7 of this licensing, and some modifications may count as plagiarism. This includes adding comments to the bottom of the first block.
 6. All files from this program that you redistribute or re-use must be under the same licensing as they originally were (this document). 
 7. None of the authors (including CrazySqueak), do not accept any liability or responsibility for any data loss, or other problems, caused by improper operation of the program, or by failure of the program. You use it at your own risk.
 8. These licensing terms may change at any time, with or without warning. If you are actively redistributing or using the program, you must regularly check this document to make sure you're up to date.
